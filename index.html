# AP CSP Semester 1 Jeopardy Exam Review (V1)
# In Thonny make sure that you have the pygame module installed
# For some more background on pygame: https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/
# We will look at pygame more next semester and some of you may use for the CPT

import pygame # A good example of Abstraction since Pygame is a library that simplifies our game development.

# Colors (Using variables to avoid hardcoding literlals to improve reusability.)
# RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is a color model used in computer graphics and other digital systems to represent colors. 
# Each color is represented by 3 values (Red, Green, Blue), where each value ranges from 0 to 255.
# These values are stored as bytes (8 bits per value). For example:
# - 0 in binary is 00000000 (all bits off)
# - 255 in binary is 11111111 (all bits on)
# Since there are 3 values, we need 3 bytes to represent a single RGB color.
# Examples:
# - WHITE = (255, 255, 255): All color channels (R, G, B) are at their maximum intensity.
# - BLACK = (0, 0, 0): All color channels are off, resulting in no light (black).
# - BLUE = (0, 0, 255): Only the blue channel is fully on.
# - GRAY = (200, 200, 200): All color channels are set to a similar mid-range intensity, producing gray.
# This use of RGB ties back to binary and data representation, a key concept in computer science.
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
GRAY = (200, 200, 200)

LARGE_FONT = pygame.font.Font(None, 48)

# Loading Sound - we will play the jeopardy theme when someone answering a question and the game will be silent otherwise. 
# (Abstraction: Pygame's `mixer` handles audio for us.)
# Important note: in order for the sound to work you will need to ut the jeopardy.mp3 file in the same folder as your python program.
# You can get this file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a560aw9rLOrL_nhyhsuwgIbO-WhpMDrI/view?usp=sharing

# Main game loop
# This section demonstrates important algorithmic concepts: sequencing, selection, and iteration.
# - Sequencing: The program executes instructions in a specific order, such as updating the screen or processing events.
# - Selection: The loop contains conditional statements (if/else) that allow the program to decide what to do based on the current state (e.g., `if team_selection_phase` or `if event.type == pygame.QUIT`).
# - Iteration: The `while running` loop ensures the game logic continuously executes as long as the program is active.
# Abstraction: This function uses other procedures (e.g., `draw_board`, `draw_feedback`) that we wrote earlier to manage complexity. Instead of placing all logic directly in the main loop, we break it into smaller, manageable functions.
# Relevance for AP CSP End of Year Exam and Create Performance Task:
# - Students are required to create algorithms that demonstrate sequencing, selection, and iteration, for their CPT projects.
# - They also need to write and call their own functions (AP calls them 'procedures'), as this program does with `draw_board` and `draw_feedback`.
# - The main loop acts as the central algorithm, coordinating the game's logic and calling the necessary abstractions to manage complexity.
